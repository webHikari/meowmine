## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Astro, HTML and CSS.
- Text editor (We recommend Visual Studio Code)
- Node.js 18 or higher.

### Install dependencies

Navigate to your project folder and install its dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Start

Once the installation is done, you can now run your app:

```
npm run dev
```

This runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
